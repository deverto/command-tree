Command Tree
------------

The command-tree is a lightweight framework to build multi level command line interfaces by using the python builtin argparse module.

The main objectives are:
 - Full argparse compatibility.
 - Use as litle as possible code to build the tree, but preserve the argparse flexibiltiy.
 - The class and function structure must looks as the cli tree.
 - Decorators, decorators everywhere. We love decorators, so we use as often as possible.
